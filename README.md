# CorpFolio

This dashboard allows one to view completed projects based on mock data. This data includes the dates, revenue generated, the employees that worked on the project and the revenue generated by the project. The data used can be accessed via this API: https://consulting-projects.academy-faculty.repl.co/

Please note that the server ‘sleeps’ after a period of inactivity. This means requests will initally timeout or may be slow. Continue to refresh at 1 minute intervals, and it will wake up.

In addition to viewing projects, there also exists profile pages for each client and each employee, which detial relevant information.

Projects can be sorted through and filtered.
